# Project intents

A project intent is a signed, frozen Juicebox V6 project launch: the contract calls for
each chain plus the publishing client's own form document, stored by Center. Publishing
costs one wallet signature and no transaction. The project exists from the moment it is
published: it has an id, a page, and a row in search. It becomes an on-chain project when
someone deploys it, either at Center's expense on the sponsored rollups or by paying for
the transaction themselves.

This guide is the canonical description of the flow. It covers who may call, the exact
envelope, publishing, reading, sponsored deploys, self-paid deploys, and the mistakes that
cost people a working omnichain project.

Say "project" in user-facing copy, with a "Deploys on first use" label. The word "intent"
belongs in API documentation, not in product copy: it suggests something still negotiable,
and a published intent cannot be edited, replaced or withdrawn.

## What an intent is

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Content | `format`, `deploymentVersion`, `chainIds`, 1 to 4 `deploymentCalls` per chain, and a `jb` document |
| Identity | A UUID assigned by Center, plus a `contentHash` over the canonical envelope |
| Authenticity | A publisher signature over a message that quotes the content hash |
| Mutability | None. There is no edit, replace or withdraw route. Publish a new intent instead |
| Status | `undeployed` until a deployment is recorded for any chain, then `deployed` |

The per-chain `to` address and the complete calldata are part of the signed content, so the
launch is directly executable and independently verifiable by anyone: nobody has to re-derive
time-sensitive arguments later. Center never edits the calldata and never invents a call.

A signature on an intent authorizes Center to store and publish frozen calldata. It is not
transaction approval and it moves no funds. Deployment is a separate, funded transaction.

## Who may call

The intent routes (`/v1/intents*` and `/v1/search`) are gated by browser `Origin`. A request
whose `Origin` header is not on Center's first-party list is refused with `403` and
`{"error":{"code":"forbidden_origin"}}`. There is no bearer token for these routes and no
public fallback. This is tighter than `/v1/rpc`, which admits any origin, including none, as a
public caller under its own budget.

Two ways in for a new integrator:

1. **Ask for an origin.** Center's first-party list lives in `src/firstParty.ts` in the
   `mejango/jbcenter` repository: one production entry per app, and several localhost and dev
   entries per app in the development list. Open a pull request adding your origin, or ask the
   maintainers. Production entries today are `https://juicebox.money`, `https://revnet.money`,
   `https://eth.shop`, `https://succulent.money`, `https://homerun.money` and `https://beep.biz`.
2. **Use the MCP tools.** Connect any Streamable HTTP MCP client to
   `https://juicebox.center/mcp`. `jb_prepare_intent`, `jb_publish_intent`, `jb_get_intent`
   and `jb_deploy_intent` run server-side inside Center, so they need no origin, no REST
   account and no bot grant. The MCP never holds a key and never signs: you bring the
   signature.

Server-to-server callers that are not the MCP still need an allow-listed origin, and must
send it as a real `Origin` header.

## The envelope

```json
{
  "format": "juicebox.money/v1",
  "deploymentVersion": "6",
  "chainIds": [8453, 42161],
  "deploymentCalls": [
    { "chainId": 8453, "to": "0x...", "data": "0x..." },
    { "chainId": 42161, "to": "0x...", "data": "0x..." }
  ],
  "jb": { "v": 1, "name": "Public goods garden", "owner": "0x...", "chainIds": [8453, 42161] }
}
```

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | string | `<host>/<label>`: exactly one slash. Host part matches `[a-z0-9.-]{1,80}`, label matches `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{1,32}` — the label may not contain a slash. Identifies the publishing client |
| `deploymentVersion` | string | `"6"`. 1 to 64 characters |
| `chainIds` | number[] | 1 to 16 unique positive integers. Center sorts them ascending before hashing |
| `deploymentCalls` | array | 1 to 4 calls, each `{chainId, to, data}`, for each member of `chainIds`, between 4 bytes and 4 MiB each. The last call for a chain is its launch call; see "Setup calls". `to` is checksummed; `data` is stored lowercased and matched case-insensitively when a self-paid deployment is verified. Center sorts by `chainId` before hashing and keeps each chain's calls in the order they were signed |
| `jb` | object | The publishing client's own document. Any JSON object, nesting at most 64 levels |

Existing publishers use `juicebox.money/v1` and `revnet.money/v1`. An app that publishes more
than one kind of deployment distinguishes them in the label, for example `homerun.money/fund.v1`
or `beep.biz/terminal.v1`. A second slash is rejected with `400` and
`format must look like juicebox.money/v1`.

### Launch entry points

Each `deploymentCall.to` is one of a small set of canonical V6 launch entry points. Look up
their per-chain addresses at `GET /api/v1/catalog/contracts` or in [`./CONTRACTS.md`](./CONTRACTS.md);
Center does not invent a call or a target.

- `JBController.launchProjectFor`
- `JB721TiersHookProjectDeployer.launchProjectFor`
- `JBOmnichainDeployer.launchProjectFor`
- `REVDeployer.deployFor`, with `revnetId` `0` for a first-time launch
- `HomerunDeployer.launchFundFor`

## Setup calls

A chain may carry more than one call. **The last call for a chain is the launch call;
every call before it is a setup call.** One call per chain is a launch call, so every
intent published before this rule existed is unchanged.

A setup call creates a Safe. Center pays for it, so it is the only thing a setup call may
do:

| Part | Required value |
|---|---|
| `to` | `0x4e1DCf7AD4e460CfD30791CCC4F9c8a4f820ec67`, the Safe 1.4.1 proxy factory. Its runtime code is checked on the chain before the sponsor pays |
| `data` | `createProxyWithNonce(singleton, initializer, saltNonce)`, encoded exactly |
| `singleton` | `0x41675C099F32341bf84BFc5382aF534df5C7461a` |
| `initializer` | `setup(owners, threshold, address(0), 0x, 0xfd0732Dc9E303f09fCEf3a7388Ad10A83459Ec99, address(0), 0, address(0))` |
| `owners` | 1 to 20 unique nonzero addresses |
| `threshold` | 1 to `owners.length` |

Anything else is refused with `400` and a message naming the call index, for example
`deploymentCalls[0].to must be the canonical Safe proxy factory`. A chain accepts at most
four calls, so at most three Safes. Two byte-identical setup calls on one chain are refused
with `deploymentCalls[1] repeats a setup call on its chain`, because the second one would
create nothing and the sponsor would pay for its revert.

A Safe 1.4.1 address depends only on the factory, the singleton, the initializer and the
salt nonce. It never depends on the sender or the time. So the Safe creation and the
launch are independent: the project can be transferred to the Safe address before the
Safe exists, and the Safe accepts the project whenever it is created. A Safe that already
exists at the predicted address costs nothing: Center drops that call from the bundle. A
Safe creation that reverts does not fail the chain; the project is owned by the predicted
address either way and anyone can create the Safe later.

The sponsored deploy sends one bundle for all chains. Center numbers a chain's entries in
that bundle, so the execution service sends the chain's Safe creations before its launch.
Nothing depends on that order; the numbering is what the service requires to send them.
The service answers with one identifier per call, in an order of its own, so Center reads the
bundle back and binds each identifier to the one submitted call whose chain, contract, calldata,
value and number all match it. Each chain's row is `sent` on its
launch transaction hash and `confirmed` when that transaction succeeds and carries the
`JBProjects.Create` event. `transactionHash` on the row and on the recorded deployment is
always the launch transaction.

### `jb.safes`

Center stores `jb` as it is given. The convention for rendering a Safe is:

```json
"safes": [
  {
    "role": "owner",
    "address": "0x...",
    "owners": ["0x...", "0x..."],
    "threshold": 2,
    "saltNonce": "0x..."
  }
]
```

### A Homerun fund that creates its own 2-of-2 owner Safe

```ts
import {
  buildSafeDeploymentCalls,
  predictSafeAddress,
  SAFE_PROXY_CREATION_CODE,
} from "@bananapus/nana-sdk-core/safe";

const policy = {
  owners: [alice, bob],
  threshold: 2,
  saltNonce,
  proxyCreationCode: SAFE_PROXY_CREATION_CODE,
};
// A plan carries the address it predicts; the SDK re-derives it and refuses a mismatch.
const owner = { ...policy, address: predictSafeAddress(policy) };

const deploymentCalls = chainIds.flatMap((chainId) => [
  ...buildSafeDeploymentCalls([owner]).map((call) => ({
    chainId,
    to: call.target,
    data: call.callData,
  })),
  {
    chainId,
    to: homerunDeployer[chainId],
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: homerunAbi,
      functionName: "launchFundFor",
      args: [owner.address, /* the rest of the fund */],
    }),
  },
]);

const envelope = {
  format: "homerun.money/fund.v1",
  deploymentVersion: "6",
  chainIds,
  deploymentCalls,
  jb: {
    ...formValues,
    owner: owner.address,
    safes: [
      {
        role: "owner",
        address: owner.address,
        owners: owner.owners,
        threshold: owner.threshold,
        saltNonce: owner.saltNonce,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

`jb.owner` is the Safe address, so the intent appears under `GET /v1/search?owner=`. A page
that lists "my projects" also filters by `publisher`, because the publishing wallet is an
owner of the Safe, not the project's owner.

### `jb` conventions

Center treats `jb` as opaque, but indexes a few conventional fields so that search and lists
work without the client re-reading every envelope. Fields are read from the root of `jb`, or
from `jb.data` when `jb.app` is `"revnet.money"`.

| `jb` field | Indexed as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `name` | Trimmed to 100 characters. Missing means the stored name is `Untitled project` |
| `description` | `description` | Trimmed to 10000 characters |
| `tagline` or `projectTagline` | `tagline` | Trimmed to 200 characters |
| `tags` | `tags` | At most 10 strings of at most 30 characters |
| `logoUri`, `logo` or `links.logoUri` | `logoUri` | Use an `ipfs://` URI: the first-party webclients do not render HTTPS logos |
| `owner` | `owner` | Indexed, stored checksummed, when it is an address string; otherwise not indexed. This is what `GET /v1/search?owner=` matches |
| `chainIds` or `chains` | not indexed | When present it must equal the envelope's `chainIds`, or the publish is refused |

Also set `app` (your client's short name) and, when your client has more than one product,
`kind`. Everything else is yours.

### Content hash and signing message

The content hash is `keccak256` over the canonical JSON of the normalized envelope: object keys
sorted lexicographically at every level, no whitespace, chain ids and calls already sorted.

The message to sign is exactly:

```
Juice Central project intent
Version: 1
Content hash: 0x<64 hex characters>
```

Never build that string yourself. Ask `POST /v1/intents/message` for it, so a change in Center's
normalization can never leave you signing something Center will not store.

## One sender per intent

Sucker, ERC-20 and 721-hook salts hash `_msgSender()` on every chain. Every chain of one intent
must be deployed by the same sender, or the deployments do not link into one omnichain project:
they land as unrelated same-named projects on separate chains, and nothing can repair that.

There are exactly two valid senders for a whole intent, never mixed:

- Center's sponsor key deploys every chain. It signs each chain's launch as an ERC-2771 forward
  request, so `_msgSender()` on the destination is the sponsor whether Center pays
  (`POST /v1/intents/:id/deploy`) or the visitor pays (`POST /v1/intents/:id/relay`).
- One wallet deploys every chain itself, paying each one and recording it.

Center enforces the boundary one chain at a time, and remembers which sender made each chain. A
recorded deployment carries `forwarded`: true when the committed call came from the canonical
`ERC2771Forwarder` with Center's sponsor as the appended sender, false when any other sender made
it, including a wallet that sent the committed call itself. A chain that already has
a deployment is refused by both routes, and one deployment that is not forwarded closes both
routes for the whole intent with `409` `mixed_sender` and retires its queued rows. So deploy a
chain Center does not sponsor with a relay request, never from your own wallet: sent from any
other address it produces different token and sucker salts.

On the sponsored path Center's sponsor key signs an ERC-2771 forward request per chain against
the canonical `ERC2771Forwarder` from the V6 manifest, after checking that the call's target
trusts that forwarder. The deployment calls themselves carry no value: the project creation fee
is read live from `JBProjects.creationFee()` at deploy time and attached to the forwarded
request, funded by the Relayr prepayment. A fee above Center's ceiling of `100000000000000` wei
(0.0001 ETH) fails the lane instead of spending more than the reservation.

## Publish end to end

### Step 1: ask for the message

```sh
curl -X POST https://juicebox.center/v1/intents/message \
  -H 'origin: https://juicebox.money' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "format":"juicebox.money/v1",
    "deploymentVersion":"6",
    "chainIds":[8453],
    "deploymentCalls":[{
      "chainId":8453,
      "to":"0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333",
      "data":"0x12345678"
    }],
    "jb":{"v":1,"name":"Public goods garden","owner":"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111","chains":[8453]}
  }'
```

```json
{
  "contentHash": "0x9a...",
  "message": "Juice Central project intent\nVersion: 1\nContent hash: 0x9a...",
  "envelope": { "format": "juicebox.money/v1", "deploymentVersion": "6", "chainIds": [8453], "deploymentCalls": [{ "chainId": 8453, "to": "0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333", "data": "0x12345678" }], "jb": { "v": 1, "name": "Public goods garden", "owner": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111", "chains": [8453] } }
}
```

### Step 2: apply the guard, then sign

Before you sign, check two things. Every publisher applies this guard; it is the only thing
standing between a compromised or confused response and a signature over calldata the user
never saw.

1. The returned `envelope` equals the envelope you built. Compare canonically: sort object keys,
   lowercase every hex string, and compare the serialized result. Do not compare with `===` on
   objects and do not trust field order.
2. The returned `message` equals, character for character, the message for the envelope you built:

   ```
   Juice Central project intent
   Version: 1
   Content hash: <hash>
   ```

   where `<hash>` is the keccak256 of the canonical JSON of that envelope. Never build this string
   yourself to sign; build it only to compare, and sign the `message` Center returned once the two
   match.

If either check fails, refuse to sign and surface the mismatch. Do not retry silently.

Sign with `personal_sign` from an externally owned account. Center recovers the signer from the
signature and compares it to `publisher`: contract signatures are not verified today, so an
ERC-1271 smart account and an ERC-6492 wrapped signature from an undeployed account are both
refused with `400`. A client whose connector cannot sign messages, such as a passkey wallet,
needs an external wallet for this step.

### Step 3: publish

```sh
curl -X POST https://juicebox.center/v1/intents \
  -H 'origin: https://juicebox.money' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "format":"juicebox.money/v1",
    "deploymentVersion":"6",
    "chainIds":[8453],
    "deploymentCalls":[{"chainId":8453,"to":"0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333","data":"0x12345678"}],
    "jb":{"v":1,"name":"Public goods garden","owner":"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111","chains":[8453]},
    "publisher":"0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
    "signature":"0x..."
  }'
```

`201` with the stored intent the first time. `200` with the same intent when the same publisher
re-sends the same content: publishing is idempotent per `(publisher, contentHash)`.

### The same flow with the SDK

`JBCenterClientOptions` has no `origin` option: a bare `createJBCenterClient()` only works from
an allow-listed browser origin, where the browser sets `Origin` itself. A server-side caller
supplies its own `fetch` that sets the header:

```ts
import {
  createJBCenterClient,
  createJBCenterDeploymentCall,
  publishSignedIntent,
} from "@bananapus/nana-sdk-core/jbcenter";

const client = createJBCenterClient({
  fetch: (input, init) =>
    fetch(input, {
      ...init,
      headers: { ...init?.headers, origin: "https://your-app.example" },
    }),
});

const deploymentCalls = chainIds.map((chainId) =>
  createJBCenterDeploymentCall({
    chainId,
    address, // the launch entry point on this chain; see "Launch entry points" above
    abi,
    functionName,
    args,
  }),
);
const envelope = {
  format: "juicebox.money/v1",
  deploymentVersion: "6",
  chainIds,
  deploymentCalls,
  jb: formValues,
};

const intent = await publishSignedIntent(
  client,
  envelope,
  (message) => walletClient.signMessage({ account, message }),
  { publisher: account.address },
);
```

`publishSignedIntent` is the guard from step 2 as one call: it prepares the intent, checks that
Center's prepared `envelope` matches the one built here and that the prepared `message` equals,
character for character, the whole signing message it builds for that envelope's own content
hash, and only then calls `sign` and publishes. Either check failing throws
`JBCenterIntentMismatchError` instead of reaching a wallet.

`publishSignedIntent`, `describeCenterRefusal`, the `homerun-fund` decode flavor and the `owner`
and `publisher` search filters need `@bananapus/nana-sdk-core` 2.8.0 or newer.

### Publish limits and refusals

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `bad_request` | The envelope failed normalization, or the signature does not match `publisher` and the content |
| `403` | `forbidden_origin` | The `Origin` header is absent or not first-party |
| `413` | `body_too_large` | The request body exceeded 16800000 bytes |
| `429` | `publish_limit` | `PUBLISH_PER_PUBLISHER_PER_DAY` publishes per publisher per day (default 20), or `PUBLISH_PER_IP_PER_HOUR` per IP per hour (default 60). `Retry-After` is `86400` or `3600` |
| `429` | `storage_limit` | The calling client exceeded its stored intent count or byte budget |

As of 2026-09-21, production runs `PUBLISH_PER_PUBLISHER_PER_DAY` at 500 and
`PUBLISH_PER_IP_PER_HOUR` at 500.

An MCP caller spends the hourly limit twice: once under its own publisher key, and once in a
bucket every MCP publisher shares. A publisher key is free to mint, so the shared bucket is what
bounds the assistant as a whole. Its stored intents and bytes count against the assistant's own
lifetime caps — `MCP_MAX_INTENTS`, default 100000, and `MCP_MAX_STORAGE_BYTES`, default 10 GiB —
rather than against a browser client's, and its sponsored deploys draw on the assistant's own
daily slice of the sponsorship budget, below.

## Read and list

### One intent

```http
GET /v1/intents/:id
```

`200` with the intent, `400` for an id that is not a UUID, `404` with `not_found` otherwise.

```json
{
  "id": "a7396c7e-b13f-4ca8-9f06-96f36ab22c3a",
  "status": "undeployed",
  "contentHash": "0x9a...",
  "envelope": { "format": "juicebox.money/v1", "deploymentVersion": "6", "chainIds": [8453], "deploymentCalls": [{ "chainId": 8453, "to": "0x...", "data": "0x..." }], "jb": {} },
  "publisher": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
  "signature": "0x...",
  "name": "Public goods garden",
  "description": null,
  "tagline": null,
  "tags": [],
  "logoUri": null,
  "owner": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-21T00:00:00.000Z",
  "deployments": [],
  "deploys": []
}
```

`deployments` holds recorded on-chain results, write-once per chain:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chainId` | The chain the project was created on |
| `projectId` | The project id the canonical `JBProjects.Create` event carried |
| `transactionHash` | The transaction Center verified |
| `forwarded` | True when the launch was sent through Center's forwarder with Center's sponsor as the appended sender, which is what lets Center sponsor or relay the remaining chains; false for a deployment any other sender made |
| `createdAt` | When Center recorded it |

`deploys` holds sponsored-deploy rows and is always present, empty until a
sponsored deploy is requested: `{chainId, status, transactionHash, bundleUuid, error, createdAt,
updatedAt}` with `status` one of `queued`, `sent`, `confirmed`, `failed`. `error` is always a
coded, authored message capped at 300 characters with secrets scrubbed before it is stored, and
it is set on a waiting row as well as a failed one.

### Search

```http
GET /v1/search?q=climate&owner=0x1111...&publisher=0x2222...&limit=20&cursor=20
```

| Parameter | Rules |
|---|---|
| `q` | At most 200 characters. Empty or absent lists recent intents newest first |
| `owner` | An address. Matches the indexed `jb.owner`, case-insensitively |
| `publisher` | An address. Matches the signing publisher, case-insensitively |
| `limit` | 1 to 100, default 20 |
| `cursor` | The `nextCursor` from the previous page: a non-negative integer offset |

All four filters combine. An `owner` or `publisher` that is not an address is refused with `400`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "source": "jbcenter",
      "status": "undeployed",
      "intentId": "a7396c7e-b13f-4ca8-9f06-96f36ab22c3a",
      "contentHash": "0x9a...",
      "format": "juicebox.money/v1",
      "deploymentVersion": "6",
      "chainIds": [8453],
      "publisher": "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222",
      "name": "Public goods garden",
      "description": null,
      "tagline": null,
      "tags": [],
      "logoUri": null,
      "owner": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
      "createdAt": "2026-09-21T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 1,
  "nextCursor": null
}
```

Search returns undeployed intents only. Recording the first deployment removes an intent from
search while keeping its `jb`, signature, exact launch calls and deployment provenance at
`GET /v1/intents/:id`. That is the contract clients rely on: query Center and Bendystraw
concurrently and concatenate, and nothing is listed twice.

`owner` is what an account page needs: `searchIntents({ owner })` beside
`getProjectsOwnedBy(owner)` from Bendystraw is the account's complete project list.
`publisher` is what an integrator's own operations dashboard needs: every intent a server key
signed, whoever owns the resulting projects.

### Rendering a list and a page

The SDK's `mergeSearch(bendystrawRows, intentItems)` merges both sources newest first, building
each intent row with `intentRow(item)` and flagging it `undeployed: true`. `intentPath(id)` is
`/intent/<id>`. Render that page from `decodeDeploymentCall(call)` on any one of the intent's
deployment calls — the launch is the same logical configuration on every chain — plus the pinned
metadata. No chain reads are needed or possible: there is nothing on chain yet.

`decodeDeploymentCall` returns a typed shell per launch flavor:

| Flavor | Typed fields |
|---|---|
| `project` | `owner`, `projectUri`, `rulesetConfigurations`, `terminalConfigurations`, `memo` |
| `project-721` | `owner`, `projectUri`, `rulesetConfigurations`, `terminalConfigurations`, `memo`, `salt` |
| `omnichain` | `owner`, `projectUri`, `rulesetConfigurations`, `terminalConfigurations`, `memo`, `has721` |
| `revnet` | `operator`, `projectUri`, `stages`, `description`, `accountingContexts` |
| `homerun-fund` | `owner`, `projectUri`, `tokenName`, `ticker`, `mustStartAtOrAfter`, `salt`, `peerSuckerDeployers` |
| `unknown` | none — render generically, never guess a shape |

Keep intents out of Trending and Top: those rankings are volume-based and an intent has no
volume.

## Sponsored deploy

```http
POST /v1/intents/:id/deploy
Content-Type: application/json

{ "chainIds": [8453] }
```

Center executes the intent's own signed calls at its own expense. The body is optional. With no
body, or with no `chainIds`, Center queues every chain of the intent that it sponsors and that
has no deployment yet. With `chainIds`, every id must be in the intent, must be one Center
sponsors, and must have no deployment; an id that already has a row comes back as it is. The
chains queued by one request must all be from one family.

An intent whose `chainIds` also name a chain Center does not sponsor, such as Ethereum, is queued
for its sponsored chains. The rest is deployed with a relay request.

| Status | Body | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `202` | `{"deploys":[...]}` | At least one chain was queued. One row per requested chain |
| `200` | `{"deploys":[...]}` | Every requested chain already has a row. The same rows come back |
| `400` | `bad_request` | The id is not a UUID, a named chain is not in the intent, is not sponsored or is already deployed, nothing sponsored is left to deploy, or the selected chains span both families |
| `404` | `not_found` | No such intent |
| `409` | `mixed_sender` | A wallet already deployed a chain of this intent. Deploy the rest from that wallet |
| `429` | `sponsor_budget` | The daily sponsorship budget is spent: the shared one, or an MCP caller's own slice of it. `Retry-After: 86400` |
| `429` | `sponsor_quota` | The requester's daily quota is spent. `Retry-After: 86400` |
| `503` | `unavailable` | No sponsor is configured, or sponsorship is paused |

The budget is checked before the quota, so a budget refusal costs the requester nothing. The
SDK's `describeCenterRefusal(error)` turns `sponsor_budget`, `sponsor_quota` and `unavailable`
into one authored sentence each, plus a generic sentence for any other `429`; it returns `null`
for a refusal it does not recognize, such as `bad_request` or `not_found`.

### Sponsored chains

| Family | Chain ids |
|---|---|
| Mainnet | `10` Optimism, `8453` Base, `42161` Arbitrum |
| Testnet | `11155111` Sepolia, `11155420` Optimism Sepolia, `84532` Base Sepolia, `421614` Arbitrum Sepolia |

The chains queued by one request must come from one family. Ethereum mainnet (`1`) is never
sponsored: an intent that includes it is queued for its sponsored chains, and Ethereum is
deployed with a relay request or from the wallet that deploys every chain.

### Cost and quotas

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Deploys per requester per day (`SPONSOR_DEPLOYS_PER_REQUESTER_PER_DAY`) | 5 |
| Shared daily budget (`SPONSOR_DAILY_BUDGET_WEI`) | 50000000000000000 wei (0.05 ETH) |
| The MCP's slice of that day (`SPONSOR_MCP_DAILY_BUDGET_WEI`) | a fifth of the shared daily budget |
| Reservation per chain | `maxGas * maxFeePerGas + creationFeeCeiling` = 8000000 * 1000000000 + 100000000000000 = 8100000000000000 wei (0.0081 ETH) |
| Confirmations before a chain counts as confirmed | 2 |

As of 2026-09-21, production raises `SPONSOR_DEPLOYS_PER_REQUESTER_PER_DAY` to 100 deploys per
requester per day; the shared daily budget runs at its default.

A request reserves the full amount for every chain up front. A reservation is released when the
chain confirms, and when a chain fails without a bundle having been paid for it; a failed row that
did pay a bundle keeps its reservation for the rest of the 24-hour window, because that money may
have left. The budget is charged what the sponsor actually spent once the Relayr prepayment
settles.

For browser callers the requester is the calling origin and IP; for the MCP tools it is one shared
Center-side bucket, so the MCP's daily sponsored deploys draw down one shared
`SPONSOR_DEPLOYS_PER_REQUESTER_PER_DAY` allowance across every MCP caller. Those deploys are also
checked against `SPONSOR_MCP_DAILY_BUDGET_WEI` before the shared budget, so a busy assistant
refuses at its own slice rather than spending the day out from under first-party apps.

### Polling

Poll `GET /v1/intents/:id` and read `deploys`. This is a `/v1` route like any other, subject to
the same 600-requests-per-minute per-caller limit (`429` `rate_limit`, `Retry-After: 60`), so
poll on an interval, not in a tight loop. A row moves `queued` to `sent` to `confirmed`, or to
`failed`. A confirmed chain also writes its `deployments` entry, so `deployments` and `deploys`
converge. A `queued` or `sent` row may carry an `error` while Center keeps retrying it:
`SPONSOR_UNFUNDED` (the sponsor key cannot cover that chain's creation fee yet),
`SPONSORSHIP_RPC_UNAVAILABLE` (a chain could not be read or simulated),
`RELAYR_INVALID_STATUS` (the execution service answered with a status Center would not bind)
and `RELAYR_TIMEOUT` (the execution service has not executed the bundle yet) are all waiting
states, not outcomes. Keep polling while `status` is not `failed`.

`failed` is set only on a definitive outcome — a reverted or unverifiable deployment, a refused
quote, an exhausted set of attempts — or after 24 hours of waiting: `bundle unresolved` for a row
whose bundle the execution service never resolved, `retries exhausted` for one that never got that
far. An operator reconciles an unresolved bundle by recording its deployment through
`POST /v1/intents/:id/deployments` once the execution service shows the hash. A `failed`
row is terminal for that intent: Center will not retry it and a second
`POST /v1/intents/:id/deploy` returns the same rows, including the failed one. Recovery is a new
intent, or the self-paid path for a fresh intent — never a partial self-paid patch over the same
one.

The SDK wraps this as `ensureDeployed({ client, intent, onStep, pollMs, timeoutMs, signal })`,
which requests the sponsored deploy, polls on a 4-second default interval until every chain is
`confirmed`, and returns `Record<chainId, projectId>`. It throws `EnsureDeployedError` carrying
the `chainId` of the row that failed.

## Relay a chain the payer sends

```http
POST /v1/intents/:id/relay
Content-Type: application/json

{ "chainId": 1 }
```

Center signs that chain's launch and hands the signed request back. Nothing is stored, nothing is
queued and no ETH leaves Center. The payer sends one transaction to the forwarder and the project
is created with Center's sponsor as its sender, so the chain pairs with every chain Center deploys
itself.

```json
{
  "chainId": 1,
  "to": "0x3bA60b60933916a7C87D0860DcEE62a0CE34E3e2",
  "data": "0x47153f82...",
  "value": "100000000000000",
  "gas": "404761",
  "deadline": 1700001800,
  "setup": []
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `to` | The canonical `ERC2771Forwarder` on that chain |
| `data` | `execute(request)` carrying the signed forward request |
| `value` | `JBProjects.creationFee()` in wei, as a decimal string. The transaction must send exactly this |
| `gas` | The gas the outer transaction needs: the signed inner gas, the 1/64 the EVM keeps back, and the forwarder's overhead |
| `deadline` | Unix seconds. The signature is valid for 30 minutes |
| `setup` | The chain's Safe creations as `{to, data, value}`, in order, minus any Safe that already exists. Send these first, from any address |

A Safe 1.4.1 address depends on the factory, the initializer and the salt, never on the sender, so
the payer creates the Safes and Center's signed launch still finds them at the same addresses. The
launch itself must stay a forwarded request; sent from any other address it produces different
token and sucker salts.

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | — | The signed request |
| `400` | `bad_request` | The id is not a UUID, `chainId` is missing or not in the intent, or that chain already has a deployment |
| `400` | `sponsored_chain` | Center deploys that chain itself. Use `POST /v1/intents/:id/deploy` |
| `404` | `not_found` | No such intent |
| `409` | `mixed_sender` | A wallet already deployed a chain of this intent. Deploy the rest from that wallet |
| `429` | `relay_limit` | 30 relay requests per requester per hour. `Retry-After: 3600` |
| `503` | `unavailable` | No sponsor is configured, or sponsorship is paused |
| `503` | `relay_unavailable` | Center could not read, simulate or sign for that chain |

Sponsored chains are refused so that a visitor and the sponsor lane never hold
the same forwarder nonce at once. Two visitors can: both get the nonce the forwarder holds now,
the first transaction to land consumes it and the second reverts. Fetch the request again and
send it. A request is valid only until its `deadline`.

Center's sponsor key must hold at least `JBProjects.creationFee()` on a relayed chain, because
both simulations send that value from the sponsor. The fee is never spent there; on Ethereum it is
`100000000000000` wei (0.0001 ETH).

When the transaction confirms, record it with `POST /v1/intents/:id/deployments` as for any chain
the payer sends. The verifier accepts the forwarded call: the trace carries the committed calldata
plus the appended sender, and the recorded deployment reads `forwarded: true`.

## Self-paid deploy and recording it

Send the intent's exact per-chain calls from one wallet, with `JBProjects.creationFee()` as the
value, then tell Center about each result:

```http
POST /v1/intents/:id/deployments
Content-Type: application/json

{ "chainId": 8453, "projectId": "123", "transactionHash": "0x..." }
```

Before writing, Center fetches the receipt and the call trace from its own RPC and requires all
of the following: a successful transaction with the configured confirmation count; exactly one
`JBProjects.Create(projectId, owner, caller)` event from the canonical `JBProjects`, and it must
be for the claimed `projectId` specifically, not merely present; and a successful direct or
nested `CALL` whose target matches the signed per-chain commitment and whose calldata is either
that commitment verbatim, or that commitment plus exactly one appended 20-byte address when the
calling frame's caller is the canonical `ERC2771Forwarder` (the forwarder appends the signer's
address to a forwarded call). Nested matching covers Safe and Relayr execution.

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `201` | — | Recorded. The body carries `forwarded`: true for a call the canonical forwarder made with Center's sponsor as the appended sender, false for one any other sender made |
| `400` | `bad_request` | Bad id, bad hash, bad `projectId`, or a `chainId` outside the intent |
| `404` | `not_found` | No such intent |
| `409` | `conflict` | A different deployment is already recorded for that chain |
| `422` | `deployment_unverified` | The trace or the event did not match the signed commitment |
| `503` | `unavailable` | Deployment verification is not configured |

Never mix senders. Recording a chain your own wallet sent closes the deploy and relay routes for
the whole intent with `409` `mixed_sender`, and the chains still queued are retired. Deploy the
rest from the same wallet. A chain Center does not sponsor is relayed, not sent from your wallet,
whenever Center deploys any other chain of the intent.

## Worked examples

### Beep: a server key publishes, the merchant owns

Beep creates a terminal for a merchant who has no wallet in hand. Beep's server key is the
`publisher`; the merchant's address is `jb.owner` and the owner inside the launch calldata. The
project is listed and has a page immediately. The first charge runs `ensureDeployed` at Beep's
single write chokepoint, before anything in the review-simulate-send pipeline, because there is
no `projectId` to write against until it resolves.

- `format`: `beep.biz/terminal.v1`
- `publisher`: Beep's server key, the only signer, on every intent
- `jb.owner`: the merchant
- Lists: `searchIntents({ publisher })` for Beep's own dashboard, `searchIntents({ owner })` for
  the merchant's projects
- Deploy: sponsored, triggered by the first charge

### Homerun: the owner publishes, chains linked by one salt

Homerun creates a FUND across sponsored rollups. The merchant's own external wallet signs, so the
merchant is both `publisher` and `jb.owner`. The client fixes one random salt and one absolute
start before building the per-chain calls, so every chain carries identical arguments and the
suckers link.

- `format`: `homerun.money/fund.v1`
- `jb`: `{ app: "homerun", kind: "fund", name, owner, chainIds, tokenName, ticker, salt, mustStartAtOrAfter, projectUri }`
- Chains: sponsored rollups only. A FUND that includes Ethereum mainnet is self-paid
- Deploy: one Deploy action on the project page, sponsored, no self-paid fallback

## Common mistakes

- **Stage 1 with `mustStartAtOrAfter: 0`.** Zero means "start now", and "now" is deploy time, not
  the time the signer saw. Every later stage boundary shifts with it. Set an absolute timestamp:
  the moment the intent is made, or an explicitly chosen future time. Stage timestamps are
  honored exactly as signed; a late deploy does not move them.
- **Deploying some chains yourself and asking Center to sponsor the rest.** The salts stop
  matching and the chains never link into one omnichain project. There is no repair. Ethereum is
  not an exception: relay it, so its sender is the sponsor like every other chain.
- **Hand-building the signing message.** Always take it from `POST /v1/intents/message`, and
  always run the two guard checks before signing.
- **Signing without comparing the prepared envelope to the local one.** The signature is over
  whatever Center normalized, not over what you meant.
- **Showing intents in Trending or Top.** Those are volume-based; an intent has none.
- **Calling them "intents" in user-facing copy.** It invites edit and withdraw requests that do
  not exist. Say "project", with a "Deploys on first use" label.
- **Treating the publish signature as transaction approval.** It authorizes storage and
  publication of frozen calldata. Deployment is a separate funded transaction.
- **Publishing from a smart account.** Center recovers the signer from the signature; a contract
  signature is refused. Publish from an externally owned account.
- **Expecting a failed sponsored row to retry.** It is terminal for that intent. A row that is
  still `queued` or `sent` with an `error` is the opposite case: Center is retrying it.
- **An HTTPS `logoUri`.** The first-party webclients render `ipfs://` only.
